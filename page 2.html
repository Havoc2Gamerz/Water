            <h2>Check Faucets and Pipes for Leaks</h2>
            <p>
              Checking for leaks will have a large impact on water conservation.
              Small drops of water can waste about 20 gallons of water per day.
              Larger leaks can be more up to hundreds of gallons. Checking for
              leaks will conserve water and will save you a lot of money on the
              water bill.

            <h2>Turning off the water when not using it</h2>
            <p>
              When you're brushing teeth or shaving or washing your car make
              sure to turn off the water. Doing that will conserve lots of
              water. Turning off the water when you're not using it, when you
              shower and brush your teeth can save up 8 gallons of water a day
              that would be more 200 gallons of water a month.

            <h2>Bathing</h2>
            <p>
              When you shower you can use up to 20 to 40 gallons of water.
              Turning off the water when soaping up can save a lot of water.
              Also taking more baths can save more water than showering
              everyday.

            <h2>Tiolet</h2>
            <p>
              Flushing material that is not supposed to be flush will cause
              problems for your plumbing, sewer system and environment. The
              material will have a hard time dissolving or at all and will cause
              issues with your toilet. If a material that doesn't dissolve well
              gets caught and nick or bends in a pipe it can create a block in
              the pipe and cause a sewer backup in a home or neighborhood.

            <h2>Collecting Water</h2>
            <p>
              Collecting rainwater can have lots of benefits. Collecting
              rainwater will conserve water because instead of having to use
              water from your home you can use rainwater. You can use rainwater
              for your garden, compost, and washing vehicles. Because you are
              using rainwater you will save money on the water bill.
